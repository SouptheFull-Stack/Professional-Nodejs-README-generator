# Professional README Generator 
        
## Description 
This is a project designed to become a tool for future projects, where a formatted README is created and formatted with your input.
This will make for a much faster creation of READMEs and can allow developers to not waste time on it and instead spend their time on their actual programs.

## Installation
This uses Node.Js, so you will need to download it via this link. https://nodejs.org/en/download
1. Once you have Node, navigate to the root directory of this application in your terminal (I personally use VScode and copy the file path).
2. Run this command to initialise JSON packages (-y automatically skips through the manual download choices): npm init -y
3. Install the inquirer dependency for version 8.2.4: npm install inquirer@8.2.4

## Usage
Below is a video tutorial of the application usage.

Once you have installed all programs and dependencies, you just need to navigate to the root directory in your terminal again, and initialise it with: node 'filename'.js.
In this instance, I have named my file index.js, so my command would be: node index.js.
Once you complete the prompts provided, if successful, it will generate a README.md within the same directory.
For this project, I have named my generated one README2.md as to not override this official README.md.
